The entire test is three hours long.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Rule of Four </h2> There are four ways you must demonstrate compentence to do well on the AP AB Calculus exam. The exam tests for Analytic, Numeric, Graphical, and Verbal understanding of Calculus concepts. Analytic refers to symbolic manipulation, Numeric refers to applying knowledge to plain numbers, Graphical refers to understanding graphs, and Verbal refers to explaining a concept in clear, concise English.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Study Tips</h2>Although you can and often should define your own functions and constants, make sure to return answers in the same format as they are given.<p>Know well the terms and notation, because questions often contain irrelivant or misleading information that requires careful discernment.</p><p>Slow and steady wins the race. If you spend enough time and effort, you will learn things that at first seem impossible.</p><p>Take practice tests, e.g., <a href='https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-calculus-ab/exam-practice'>the 1988 and 1998 released exams,</a> which will be referenced throughout this website. On worksheets, practice problems, and practice exams, find all questions you missed, learn how to do them and correct them.</p><p>Approach every topic from every rule of four skill that can apply.</p><p>Get familiar with the TI 84. Specifically, get familiar with <a href='https://brownmath.com/ti83/deriv.htm'>nderiv</a> and fnint <a href='https://brownmath.com/ti83/integr.htm'>for older</a> and <a href='https://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=100842'>for newer</a> calculators. Furthermore, understand that y1-y9-y10 on the y= button are functions and can be evaluated at a point, e.g., entering y1(0) in the main window evaluates y1 at x=0. Also note that you can use sto&gt; to store the result of an evaluation, including storing x and y. It is also helpful to <a href='http://www.instructables.com/id/Quadratic-Formula-for-the-TI-83-and-84/'>add the quadratic formula to your calculator.</a><p> Keep your precal knowledge fresh. Especially volume, domain, range, peicewise functions, and values for sine and cosine. Some identities for sine and cosine are also often helpful, especially sin&#94;2 + cos&#94;2 = 1. Make sure you know how to graph trig functions with and without a calculator.<p>It is helpful to note the relative values of pi and e: 3.1&lt;pi&lt;3.2 and 2.7&lt;e&lt;2.8.</p><p>The point slope formula, y = mx + b, will slow you down. You can move more quickly through the exam with y = m(x-x1) + y1, and on the free response questions the answers are expected in this form.</p>"

For instance, if you move forward one step, then half that step, and so on, you can never repeat that infinity times, but as you approach infinity repititions, you approach two full steps in distance.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Ways of Solving Limits</h2>You can use a graph, properties for limits, direct substitution, simplify for direct substitution, a table or chart, l&#39;hopital&#39;s rule, reasoning about rates, or use memorized limits.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>One Sided Limits</h2> A one sided limit is a limit that only approaches from one side of the graph. There notation looks like this: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/ewx0KIj.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. This is the limit of f of x as x approaches a from the left side. If there was a plus above the a instead of a minus, it would be from the right side. An easy way to remember the difference is that if there is a negative above the value, x&lt;value, and if there is a positive above the value, x&gt;value.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Existance of the Limit</h2> If for a value c, <img src='http://i.imgur.com/BK0DAXQ.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, then the limit as f of x approaches c exists.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Continuity</h2> Limits can be used to find out if a function is continuous at a point. The function f is continuous at the value x=c if <img src='http://i.imgur.com/3eSuYg9.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. <h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Intermediate Value Theorem and Sandwitch Theorem</h2>The intermediate value theorem states that, if f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and k is any value such that k is between a and b, then there is at least one c in [a,b] such that f(c) = k. In other words, to go from one elevation to another you have to pass through the points in between. <p>The squeeze theorem states that, if h(x)&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x) for all x in an open interval containing a point c, except possibly at point c itself, and <img src='http://i.imgur.com/a7R4Qg1.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches c exists and is equal to L.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Asymptotes as Limits</h2>Vertical asymptotes can be seen as limits that approach infinity as x approaches a point. Horizontal asymptotes can be seen as limits that approach a constant, such as zero, as x approaches infinity.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Properties of Limits</h2>Khan academy provides some <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/continuity-ab/limits-of-combined-and-composite-func-ab/v/limit-properties'>very helpful videos</a> about the properties of limits. They are helpful especially when using memorized limits, as you can use the properties to &quot;factor out&quot; or &quot;add and subtract&quot; to break the limit down into previously memorized ones.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Limits to Memorize</h2><img src='http://i.imgur.com/5P8dtNj.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p><img src='http://i.imgur.com/bcOqsUa.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p>Limits from <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a><img src='http://i.imgur.com/xiyEZ5I.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Limits from <a href='http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit+as+x+approaches+infinity+of+(1+%2B+1%2Fx)%5Ex'>Wolfram Alpha:</a>  <img src='http://i.imgur.com/TkTAL02.gif' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>   <img src='http://i.imgur.com/w5NGt0T.gif' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>An Example</h2>Consider this example. <img src='http://calccenter.x10host.com/limexamplev1cropped.svg' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>.

Furthermore, intuitive reasoning about rates would be that the top grows at 3x while the bottom grows at x, so the answer is three.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Solving limits with a graph: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 76</p><p>Solving limits with their properties: example given above</p>Solving limits with direct substitution (there must be no continuity): &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 12</p><p>Solving limits with simplification for direct substitution: See <a href='http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/limits-calculus.html'> this article on Online Math Learning under factoring and canceling</a></p><p>Solving limits with a table or chart: Enter (1+X)^(1/X) into the Y1 function of your calculator.

The dydx and f&#39;(x) notations are referred to as Leibniz&#39;s notation and Newton&#39;s notation respectivley.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Definition of the Derivative</h2>From <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a><img src='http://i.imgur.com/PlsUJEf.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img> This is the definition of the derivative.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Existance of the Derivative</h2>If a derivative of a function exists at a point, the function is &quot;differentiable&quot; at that point. Functions are differentiable at a point c if <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/differentiable_zps4suidssu.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Graphically, if there is a corner at a point, such as the graph of f(x) = |x| at x = 0, or a cusp (a sharp point), such as <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5B1+%2B+x+-+(x%5E2+(1+-+Sqrt%5B7%5D+x%5E2)%5E2)%5E(1%2F3),+%7Bx,+-1.0,+1.0%7D%5D'>this monstrosity of a function,</a> then the derivative does not exist.</p><p>If the derivative exists at a point, the function is continuous at that point. The converse is not true: if the function is continuous at a point, the function may be differentiable at that point or it may not be, as in the corner and cusps.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>What a Derivative Means</h2>Derivatives represent the rate of change and the slope of the tangent line. If you see &quot;rate of change&quot; or &quot;slope of tangent line&quot;, think derivative.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Derivatives</h2>You can find derivatives by definition: just plug the function into the definintion and find the limit, usually by simplification.<p>You can (and usually should) use memorized rules. One easy rule to remember is that the derivative of a constant is zero. Another easy rule is that derivatives add and subtract easily: taking the derivative of f(x) + g(x) yeilds f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x). The rest of the rules that you need to know from memory, from <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a></p><p>Power rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/ECAKwOv.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>Product rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/by740HL.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>Quotient rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/rKdAF8i.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Chain rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/YWSuvCI.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p> Note that the chain rule can be confusing, so go from the outside in and break everything down into equivalent symbols if you get confused.</p><p>It is important to memorize the derivatives of trigonometric functions and some other non polynomial functions as their differentiation is not fast nor straightforward. From <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a></p><p><img src='http://i.imgur.com/haa1DK7.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed'></img></p><p>Another way to find derivatives is to find the slope at a point. This is often necessary when you are given a graph or table of values. Sometimes, secant lines can work as approximations for the tangent at a certain value. Questions that ask for an approximation of the derivative&#47;tangent usually want you to find the tangent between the two points next to the point in question or the secant line that goes through the point in question and the other closest point.</p><p>Another way of finding derivatives, called implicit derivation, is necessary when you cannot seperate the y from the x. It is more convienient in this case to use Leibniz&#39;s notation. In implicit derivation, the derivative of y is dy&#47;dx and the derivatives of xy, y&#94;2 and so on are found using derivative rules such as the product rule and chain rule. To extend those examples, the derivative of xy can be found using the product rule and it is y + x&#42;(dy&#47;dx), and the derivative of y&#94;2 can be found using the chain rule and it is 2(y)dy&#47;dx.</p><p>One other way to find a derivative is using the Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus. If you have not learned integrals yet, skip this section for now. <a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SecondFundamentalTheoremofCalculus.html'>Wolfram Mathworld</a> gives a short and easy to understand definition of the second fundemental theorem of calculus. Note that, in the definition, x is on top part of the limit and a constant is on the bottom. To use the Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus, your integral must look like that. The properties of integrals provide some tricks to put the integral in a form for which you can use the theorem: the integral from points a to b can be split up into the integral from points a to c plus the integral from c to b provided a&lt;c&lt;b, and the integral from points d and e is equal to negative one times the integral from e to d. So if you have x on the bottom and a constant on the top, you can flip it by multiplying the integral by negative one, and if you have x on the bottom and x^2 on the top you can separate them into an integral from x to c plus the integral from c to x^2, then flip the one that has x on the bottom.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Derivative by Defintion: Confirm some of the easier rules to confirm, e.g., find the derivative of sin(x) and cos(x) using the definition (hint: break it up into memorized limits) and find the derivative of polynomial functions with both the power rule and the defintion.</p><p>Derivative rules, including memorized derivatives:&#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, 16, 18, 28, 78, 87, 90 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 18, 24</p><p>Implicit Derivation: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 6, Free Response 4a, Free Response 6a &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 9</p>";

          appder.onclick = function() {
          document.getElementById("pagetitle").innerHTML = "Applications of the Derivative";
          document.getElementById("pagecontent").innerHTML = "<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>How Derivatives Are Applied</h2>In general, derivatives are used to find the rate of something with respect to something else, the tangent line at a point, and the biggest and smallest values of a function over a certain domain.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Velocity and Acceleration as Derivatives</h2> The derivative of position with respect to time is velocity. This is usually written s&#39;(t) = v(t), where s(t) is position and v(t) is velocity. The derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. This is usually written v&#39;(t) = a(t), where a(t) is acceleration. Note that when you take the derivative of position, you lose information about the position because you lose where the position started at t=0, and when you take the derivative of velocity, you lose information about velocity for the same reason.<p>If the velocity is zero, the position is either changing direction or stopping. This is easy to visualize: imagine yourself in a car. You are only going at zero miles per hour if you are stopped or if the slope of the road or some other factor causes you to roll backwards when you were going forwards and vice versa. If you are going fowards then rolling backwards, your velocity started at a positive number and decreased past zero, so you must have stopped at one point.</p><p>Speed is the absolute value of velocity. Speed is only increasing, or in other words, speeding up, when the signs of velocity and acceleration are the same. Speed is only decreasing, or slowing down, when the signs of velocity and acceleration are different. As a result, if something has negative velocity and negative acceleration, it is speeding up.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding the Derivative of an Inverse Function</h2>Brace yourself: a lot of symbols are coming. They may look ugly, but they make this a simple plug-in formula.<p>If g(x) is the inverse of f(x), you can find g'(x) with the formula<img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/functionfwinvg_zpsqwclzepc.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>If you look at this formula and say &quot;Oh, all I have to do is find the inverse at x, then find the derivative at that value, then take what I have and divide one bye it!&quot;, great. If you don&#39;t think that, don&#39;t worry. It is an ugly looking formula, but you can untangle it like this:</p><p>Make a chart with two columns, f(x) and g(x). Under the g(x) column write this: (x, ), where x is the value of x that you are trying to find the value of the derivative of the inverse for. Then under f(x) write this: ( ,x). Set f(x) equal to zero and solve for x. Now fill in the f(x) column like this: (a,x) where a is the solution you found. Fill in g(x) like this (x,a). Find f&#39;(a). Divide the one by the value of f&#39;(a). That is your answer. Congratulations, you now know all the steps to solving this sort of problem.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Maximums and Minimums</h2>A critical point of a function is the point where the derivative of the funciton is equal to zero. If you are tasked with finding a maximum or minimum, find where the derivative is equal to zero by setting f&#39;(x)=0 and solving for x. Now that you know the critical points, make a table of values or a graph on your calculator to find which of those zeros involve the derivative changing signs, or in other words, crossing the x axis. When the derivative goes from positive to negative it is a local maximum, and when it goes from negative to positive it is a minimum. Now you know the x values of the local maximums and minimums. If you are tasked with finding the highest and lowest values on an interval, find the value of the function (not the derivative) at the endpoints of the interval and compare them to the function at the critical points, as the endpoints are possible maximums and minimums. If you are asked to find the absolute maximum or minimum, test the function at the critical points and compare it to the limit of the function as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Related Rates</h2>Some equations, like the ones that find volume, relate some variables to other variables. Solving such problems involves implicit derivation and solving out variables. On your exam, you will most likely have a question where something is flowing into or out of a cone. To solve such a problem, consider the volume of a cone: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/volcone_zpsq57fgmpp.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. Also consider that the ratio of radius to height remains constant for similar cones. Set r/h equal to the given radius and height at a certain time, take the implicit derivative of what you have with respect to time, and plug in the rest of the values. Other rates that are often related include triangles and right angles, for which you should remember the a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and sin, cosine, and tangent, and surface areas of cubes or spheres, the formulas being 6s^2 and 4pi(r^2) respectivley, which are related to their volumes, s^3 and (4/3)pi(r^3) respectivley.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Tangent Lines</h2>Derivatives are the slope of tangent lines, a relationship that works both ways. Find a tangent line with this formula: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/tangent_zpsxo68embg.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. Of course, this formula is just y-y1=m(x-x1), but with f(x) notation instead of y and with the derivative as the slope. As normal lines are just lines perpendicular to the tangent, to find a normal line you simply need to replace f&#39;(x) with -1/f&#39;(x).<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Inflection Points and Concavity</h2>A function&#39;s concavity is just the sign of the second derivative. Visually, drop soup onto the function you have. If the soup rolls down out of the line, you have negative concavity. If the soup stays in the line, you have positive concavity.<p>Inflection points are where the concavity changes. To find inflection points, find where the second derivative changes signs by making a table of values. If you are given a graph of a function, just look for points where the soup changes from rolling down to staying in or vice versa. If you are given a graph of a derivative, look for where the derivative goes from increasing to decreasing (maxes and mins of the derivative).</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Velocity, Acceleration, and Distance: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 24, Free Response 3a, 3b, 3c &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 16, Free Response 2a, 2b</p><p>Derivative of Inverse Function: <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/advanced-differentiation-ab/derivatives-of-inverse-functions-ab/e/derivatives-of-inverse-functions'>Khan Acacemy has practice problems similar to those you might see on the exam.</a></p><p>Finding Critical Points from the Derivative: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 24, 26, 79, 80, 81, 89, 91, Free Response 2b, 2c, 2d &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 20, 33, Free Response 4b</p><p>Related Rates: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 78, 90 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 40b</p><p>Inflection points and Concavity: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 19, 23 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 4, 8, 20, Free Response 4c</p><p>Optimization: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 45</p><p>Rates: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, 17, 22, Free Response 3a</p><p>Tangent lines: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 13, 18, 77, 87, 91, &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 11, Free Response 1d</p><p>Anylitic: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 18, 19, 22, 24, 77, 78, 79, 81, 87, 89, 90, Free Response 2d, 3a, 4b &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 4, 11, 16, 20, 33, 40</p><p>Numeric: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 26, 91 </p><p>Graphical: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 13, 17, 23, 80 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 8 Free Response 4d</p><p>Verbal: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, Free Response 2b, 2c</p>";

The entire test is three hours long.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Rule of Four </h2> There are four ways you must demonstrate compentence to do well on the AP AB Calculus exam. The exam tests for Analytic, Numeric, Graphical, and Verbal understanding of Calculus concepts. Analytic refers to symbolic manipulation, Numeric refers to applying knowledge to plain numbers, Graphical refers to understanding graphs, and Verbal refers to explaining a concept in clear, concise English.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Study Tips</h2>Although you can and often should define your own functions and constants, make sure to return answers in the same format as they are given.<p>Know well the terms and notation, because questions often contain irrelivant or misleading information that requires careful discernment.</p><p>Slow and steady wins the race. If you spend enough time and effort, you will learn things that at first seem impossible.</p><p>Take practice tests, e.g., <a href='https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-calculus-ab/exam-practice'>the 1988 and 1998 released exams,</a> which will be referenced throughout this website. On worksheets, practice problems, and practice exams, find all questions you missed, learn how to do them and correct them.</p><p>Approach every topic from every rule of four skill that can apply.</p><p>Get familiar with the TI 84. Specifically, get familiar with <a href='https://brownmath.com/ti83/deriv.htm'>nderiv</a> and fnint <a href='https://brownmath.com/ti83/integr.htm'>for older</a> and <a href='https://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=100842'>for newer</a> calculators. Furthermore, understand that y1-y9-y10 on the y= button are functions and can be evaluated at a point, e.g., entering y1(0) in the main window evaluates y1 at x=0. Also note that you can use sto&gt; to store the result of an evaluation, including storing x and y. It is also helpful to <a href='http://www.instructables.com/id/Quadratic-Formula-for-the-TI-83-and-84/'>add the quadratic formula to your calculator.</a><p> Keep your precal knowledge fresh. Especially volume, domain, range, peicewise functions, and values for sine and cosine. Some identities for sine and cosine are also often helpful, especially sin&#94;2 + cos&#94;2 = 1. Make sure you know how to graph trig functions with and without a calculator.<p>It is helpful to note the relative values of pi and e: 3.1&lt;pi&lt;3.2 and 2.7&lt;e&lt;2.8.</p><p>The point slope formula, y = mx + b, will slow you down. You can move more quickly through the exam with y = m(x-x1) + y1, and on the free response questions the answers are expected in this form.</p>"

For instance, if you move forward one step, then half that step, and so on, you can never repeat that infinity times, but as you approach infinity repititions, you approach two full steps in distance.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Ways of Solving Limits</h2>You can use a graph, properties for limits, direct substitution, simplify for direct substitution, a table or chart, l&#39;hopital&#39;s rule, reasoning about rates, or use memorized limits.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>One Sided Limits</h2> A one sided limit is a limit that only approaches from one side of the graph. There notation looks like this: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/ewx0KIj.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. This is the limit of f of x as x approaches a from the left side. If there was a plus above the a instead of a minus, it would be from the right side. An easy way to remember the difference is that if there is a negative above the value, x&lt;value, and if there is a positive above the value, x&gt;value.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Existance of the Limit</h2> If for a value c, <img src='http://i.imgur.com/BK0DAXQ.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, then the limit as f of x approaches c exists.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Continuity</h2> Limits can be used to find out if a function is continuous at a point. The function f is continuous at the value x=c if <img src='http://i.imgur.com/3eSuYg9.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. <h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Intermediate Value Theorem and Sandwitch Theorem</h2>The intermediate value theorem states that, if f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and k is any value such that k is between a and b, then there is at least one c in [a,b] such that f(c) = k. In other words, to go from one elevation to another you have to pass through the points in between. <p>The squeeze theorem states that, if h(x)&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x) for all x in an open interval containing a point c, except possibly at point c itself, and <img src='http://i.imgur.com/a7R4Qg1.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches c exists and is equal to L.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Asymptotes as Limits</h2>Vertical asymptotes can be seen as limits that approach infinity as x approaches a point. Horizontal asymptotes can be seen as limits that approach a constant, such as zero, as x approaches infinity.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Properties of Limits</h2>Khan academy provides some <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/continuity-ab/limits-of-combined-and-composite-func-ab/v/limit-properties'>very helpful videos</a> about the properties of limits. They are helpful especially when using memorized limits, as you can use the properties to &quot;factor out&quot; or &quot;add and subtract&quot; to break the limit down into previously memorized ones.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Limits to Memorize</h2><img src='http://i.imgur.com/5P8dtNj.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p><img src='http://i.imgur.com/bcOqsUa.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p>Limits from <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a><img src='http://i.imgur.com/xiyEZ5I.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Limits from <a href='http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit+as+x+approaches+infinity+of+(1+%2B+1%2Fx)%5Ex'>Wolfram Alpha:</a>  <img src='http://i.imgur.com/TkTAL02.gif' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>   <img src='http://i.imgur.com/w5NGt0T.gif' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>An Example</h2>Consider this example. <img src='http://calccenter.x10host.com/limexamplev1cropped.svg' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>.

Furthermore, intuitive reasoning about rates would be that the top grows at 3x while the bottom grows at x, so the answer is three.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Solving limits with a graph: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 76</p><p>Solving limits with their properties: example given above</p>Solving limits with direct substitution (there must be no continuity): &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 12</p><p>Solving limits with simplification for direct substitution: See <a href='http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/limits-calculus.html'> this article on Online Math Learning under factoring and canceling</a></p><p>Solving limits with a table or chart: Enter (1+X)^(1/X) into the Y1 function of your calculator.

The dydx and f&#39;(x) notations are referred to as Leibniz&#39;s notation and Newton&#39;s notation respectivley.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Definition of the Derivative</h2>From <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a><img src='http://i.imgur.com/PlsUJEf.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img> This is the definition of the derivative.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Existance of the Derivative</h2>If a derivative of a function exists at a point, the function is &quot;differentiable&quot; at that point. Functions are differentiable at a point c if <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/differentiable_zps4suidssu.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Graphically, if there is a corner at a point, such as the graph of f(x) = |x| at x = 0, or a cusp (a sharp point), such as <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5B1+%2B+x+-+(x%5E2+(1+-+Sqrt%5B7%5D+x%5E2)%5E2)%5E(1%2F3),+%7Bx,+-1.0,+1.0%7D%5D'>this monstrosity of a function,</a> then the derivative does not exist.</p><p>If the derivative exists at a point, the function is continuous at that point. The converse is not true: if the function is continuous at a point, the function may be differentiable at that point or it may not be, as in the corner and cusps.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>What a Derivative Means</h2>Derivatives represent the rate of change and the slope of the tangent line. If you see &quot;rate of change&quot; or &quot;slope of tangent line&quot;, think derivative.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Derivatives</h2>You can find derivatives by definition: just plug the function into the definintion and find the limit, usually by simplification.<p>You can (and usually should) use memorized rules. One easy rule to remember is that the derivative of a constant is zero. Another easy rule is that derivatives add and subtract easily: taking the derivative of f(x) + g(x) yeilds f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x). The rest of the rules that you need to know from memory, from <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a></p><p>Power rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/ECAKwOv.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>Product rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/by740HL.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>Quotient rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/rKdAF8i.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>Chain rule: <img src='http://i.imgur.com/YWSuvCI.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p> Note that the chain rule can be confusing, so go from the outside in and break everything down into equivalent symbols if you get confused.</p><p>It is important to memorize the derivatives of trigonometric functions and some other non polynomial functions as their differentiation is not fast nor straightforward. From <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/dgrahamcalculus/ap-calculus-ab'>Doug Graham's Calculus AP Bible:</a></p><p><img src='http://i.imgur.com/haa1DK7.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed'></img></p><p>Another way to find derivatives is to find the slope at a point. This is often necessary when you are given a graph or table of values. Sometimes, secant lines can work as approximations for the tangent at a certain value. Questions that ask for an approximation of the derivative&#47;tangent usually want you to find the tangent between the two points next to the point in question or the secant line that goes through the point in question and the other closest point.</p><p>Another way of finding derivatives, called implicit derivation, is necessary when you cannot seperate the y from the x. It is more convienient in this case to use Leibniz&#39;s notation. In implicit derivation, the derivative of y is dy&#47;dx and the derivatives of xy, y&#94;2 and so on are found using derivative rules such as the product rule and chain rule. To extend those examples, the derivative of xy can be found using the product rule and it is y + x&#42;(dy&#47;dx), and the derivative of y&#94;2 can be found using the chain rule and it is 2(y)dy&#47;dx.</p><p>One other way to find a derivative is using the Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus. If you have not learned integrals yet, skip this section for now. <a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SecondFundamentalTheoremofCalculus.html'>Wolfram Mathworld</a> gives a short and easy to understand definition of the second fundemental theorem of calculus. Note that, in the definition, x is on top part of the limit and a constant is on the bottom. To use the Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus, your integral must look like that. The properties of integrals provide some tricks to put the integral in a form for which you can use the theorem: the integral from points a to b can be split up into the integral from points a to c plus the integral from c to b provided a&lt;c&lt;b, and the integral from points d and e is equal to negative one times the integral from e to d. So if you have x on the bottom and a constant on the top, you can flip it by multiplying the integral by negative one, and if you have x on the bottom and x^2 on the top you can separate them into an integral from x to c plus the integral from c to x^2, then flip the one that has x on the bottom.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Derivative by Defintion: Confirm some of the easier rules to confirm, e.g., find the derivative of sin(x) and cos(x) using the definition (hint: break it up into memorized limits) and find the derivative of polynomial functions with both the power rule and the defintion.</p><p>Derivative rules, including memorized derivatives:&#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, 16, 18, 28, 78, 87, 90 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 18, 24</p><p>Implicit Derivation: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 6, Free Response 4a, Free Response 6a &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 9</p>";

          appder.onclick = function() {
          document.getElementById("pagetitle").innerHTML = "Applications of the Derivative";
          document.getElementById("pagecontent").innerHTML = "<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>How Derivatives Are Applied</h2>In general, derivatives are used to find the rate of something with respect to something else, the tangent line at a point, and the biggest and smallest values of a function over a certain domain.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Velocity and Acceleration as Derivatives</h2> The derivative of position with respect to time is velocity. This is usually written s&#39;(t) = v(t), where s(t) is position and v(t) is velocity. The derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. This is usually written v&#39;(t) = a(t), where a(t) is acceleration. Note that when you take the derivative of position, you lose information about the position because you lose where the position started at t=0, and when you take the derivative of velocity, you lose information about velocity for the same reason.<p>If the velocity is zero, the position is either changing direction or stopping. This is easy to visualize: imagine yourself in a car. You are only going at zero miles per hour if you are stopped or if the slope of the road or some other factor causes you to roll backwards when you were going forwards and vice versa. If you are going fowards then rolling backwards, your velocity started at a positive number and decreased past zero, so you must have stopped at one point.</p><p>Speed is the absolute value of velocity. Speed is only increasing, or in other words, speeding up, when the signs of velocity and acceleration are the same. Speed is only decreasing, or slowing down, when the signs of velocity and acceleration are different. As a result, if something has negative velocity and negative acceleration, it is speeding up.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding the Derivative of an Inverse Function</h2>Brace yourself: a lot of symbols are coming. They may look ugly, but they make this a simple plug-in formula.<p>If g(x) is the inverse of f(x), you can find g'(x) with the formula<img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/functionfwinvg_zpsqwclzepc.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img></p><p>If you look at this formula and say &quot;Oh, all I have to do is find the inverse at x, then find the derivative at that value, then take what I have and divide one bye it!&quot;, great. If you don&#39;t think that, don&#39;t worry. It is an ugly looking formula, but you can untangle it like this:</p><p>Make a chart with two columns, f(x) and g(x). Under the g(x) column write this: (x, ), where x is the value of x that you are trying to find the value of the derivative of the inverse for. Then under f(x) write this: ( ,x). Set f(x) equal to zero and solve for x. Now fill in the f(x) column like this: (a,x) where a is the solution you found. Fill in g(x) like this (x,a). Find f&#39;(a). Divide the one by the value of f&#39;(a). That is your answer. Congratulations, you now know all the steps to solving this sort of problem.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Maximums and Minimums</h2>A critical point of a function is the point where the derivative of the funciton is equal to zero. If you are tasked with finding a maximum or minimum, find where the derivative is equal to zero by setting f&#39;(x)=0 and solving for x. Now that you know the critical points, make a table of values or a graph on your calculator to find which of those zeros involve the derivative changing signs, or in other words, crossing the x axis. When the derivative goes from positive to negative it is a local maximum, and when it goes from negative to positive it is a minimum. Now you know the x values of the local maximums and minimums. If you are tasked with finding the highest and lowest values on an interval, find the value of the function (not the derivative) at the endpoints of the interval and compare them to the function at the critical points, as the endpoints are possible maximums and minimums. If you are asked to find the absolute maximum or minimum, test the function at the critical points and compare it to the limit of the function as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Related Rates</h2>Some equations, like the ones that find volume, relate some variables to other variables. Solving such problems involves implicit derivation and solving out variables. On your exam, you will most likely have a question where something is flowing into or out of a cone. To solve such a problem, consider the volume of a cone: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/volcone_zpsq57fgmpp.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. Also consider that the ratio of radius to height remains constant for similar cones. Set r/h equal to the given radius and height at a certain time, take the implicit derivative of what you have with respect to time, and plug in the rest of the values. Other rates that are often related include triangles and right angles, for which you should remember the a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and sin, cosine, and tangent, and surface areas of cubes or spheres, the formulas being 6s^2 and 4pi(r^2) respectivley, which are related to their volumes, s^3 and (4/3)pi(r^3) respectivley.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Tangent Lines</h2>Derivatives are the slope of tangent lines, a relationship that works both ways. Find a tangent line with this formula: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/tangent_zpsxo68embg.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. Of course, this formula is just y-y1=m(x-x1), but with f(x) notation instead of y and with the derivative as the slope. As normal lines are just lines perpendicular to the tangent, to find a normal line you simply need to replace f&#39;(x) with -1/f&#39;(x).<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Inflection Points and Concavity</h2>A function&#39;s concavity is just the sign of the second derivative. Visually, drop soup onto the function you have. If the soup rolls down out of the line, you have negative concavity. If the soup stays in the line, you have positive concavity.<p>Inflection points are where the concavity changes. To find inflection points, find where the second derivative changes signs by making a table of values. If you are given a graph of a function, just look for points where the soup changes from rolling down to staying in or vice versa. If you are given a graph of a derivative, look for where the derivative goes from increasing to decreasing (maxes and mins of the derivative).</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Velocity, Acceleration, and Distance: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 24, Free Response 3a, 3b, 3c &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 16, Free Response 2a, 2b</p><p>Derivative of Inverse Function: <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/advanced-differentiation-ab/derivatives-of-inverse-functions-ab/e/derivatives-of-inverse-functions'>Khan Acacemy has practice problems similar to those you might see on the exam.</a></p><p>Finding Critical Points from the Derivative: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 24, 26, 79, 80, 81, 89, 91, Free Response 2b, 2c, 2d &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 20, 33, Free Response 4b</p><p>Related Rates: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 78, 90 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 40b</p><p>Inflection points and Concavity: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 19, 23 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 4, 8, 20, Free Response 4c</p><p>Optimization: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 45</p><p>Rates: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, 17, 22, Free Response 3a</p><p>Tangent lines: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 13, 18, 77, 87, 91, &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 11, Free Response 1d</p><p>Anylitic: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 14, 18, 19, 22, 24, 77, 78, 79, 81, 87, 89, 90, Free Response 2d, 3a, 4b &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 4, 11, 16, 20, 33, 40</p><p>Numeric: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 26, 91 </p><p>Graphical: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 13, 17, 23, 80 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 8 Free Response 4d</p><p>Verbal: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 10, Free Response 2b, 2c</p>";

          document.getElementById("pagetitle").innerHTML = "The Integral";
          document.getElementById("pagecontent").innerHTML = "<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>What an Integral Is</h2>An integral is all the area under the curve added up, or the net change in something.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Antiderivatives</h2>An antiderivative is the opposite of a derivative. For instance, if f(x)=x^2 and f&#39;(x)=2x, f(x) is an antiderivative of f&#39;(x). Since derivatives lose information about constants because the derivative of a constant is zero, there are infinite antiderivatives for a function.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Integral Notation</h2>The integral of f(x) from a to b with respect to x looks like this: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/integralnot_zpsqwjkfcyl.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. The indefinite integral is the same thing without the a and the b. By the way, the a and b are referred to as &quot;limits&qout;, and the f(x) part in the integral is the integrand.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>First Fundemental Theorem of Calculus</h2>The first fundemental theorem of calculus relates antiderivatives to integrals with this formula for definite integrals: <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/fftoc_zps3zchzhrw.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, where F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x). If you dont have a definite integral (an integral with limits), you can find the integral as the antiderivative, but you must put a + C on the antiderivative side to indicate you do not know if there was a constant that became zero when the derivative was taken.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Reimann Sums</h2>Reimann sums involve splitting up a curve into slabs with corners coresponding with values of the function at at least one of the points. A left Reimann sum means that the corners are at the left value, a right Reimann sum means that the corners are on the right side, and a Trapazoidal sum is the average of the two. The left reimann sum is an overestimate where the function is decreasing and an underestimate where the function is increasing while the right sum is an overestimate where the function is increasing and an underestimate while it is decreasing. A midpoint sum means that the corners dont necessarily touch the function but instead the height of the rectangles are based on the height of the function between the points that are the bottom corners of the rectangles.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Integrals</h2>You can find integrals by:<p>The first fundemental theorem of calculus, either by finding the antiderivative and using information about the antiderivative to solve for C or by evaluating a definite integral.</p><p>Reversing derivative rules: find the antiderivative by reversing derivative rules, then use information about the antiderivative to solve for the + C. Note that you can reverse all derivative rules including the limit definition of the derivative.</p>U substitution: set u equal to a part on the inside that will undergo the chain rule, replace that part on the inside of the integral with u, and find du (the derivative of u), and change the dx (with respect to x part) with du. Then reverse derivative rules to find the integral, and replace u with what you set it equal to.</p><p>Adding up geometric area: sometimes you are given a graph, which sometimes has areas you can find with percision (triangles, circles, and things made out of triangles and circles) and sometimes has areas which you can only estimate.</p><p>Approximation with Riemann: You are often asked to do this when you are given a table of values with f(x) and x. To solve these problems, find the x values that will be the endpoints of the rectangle, and circle them along with the f(x) value that goes with the left of the two numbers for left sum or the value that goes with the right of the two numbers for a right sum. If it asks for a trapazoidal sum, find both the left and right sums and average them. If it asks for a midpoint sum, find or estimate f(x) at the point halfway between the two endpoints of the rectangle, and multiply that by the distance between the two endpoints to find the area of that rectangle.</p><p>Integration by Parts: This is not officially a topic on the AB exam, but it is a useful tool that is necessary for finding the integral of some functions not on the exam and may be easier than other methods for finding integrals of functions that are on the exam. It is probably easiest to get this skill down by <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/integration-techniques-calc/integration-by-parts-calc/v/antiderivative-of-xcosx-using-integration-by-parts'>following along as someone else does it.</a></p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Integral Notation: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 39</p><p>Finding Definite Integrals with the First Fundemental Theorem of Calculus: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 10</p><p>Finding Integrals by Reversing Derivative Rules: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 3, 7, 11, 20, 22 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 5, 7, 14, 17, 19, 28, 38, 29</p><p>Finding Integrals by Geometric Area: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 2, 9</p><p>Approximating an Integral with a Reimann Sum: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 85</p><p>Integral Notation: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 39</p><p>Finding integrals with uv substitution: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 26</p><p>Anylitic: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 3, 7, 11, 20, 21 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, 26, 28, 29, 38</p><p>Numeric: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 85 Free Response 3d</p><p>Graphical: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 2, 9</p><p>Verbal: &#39;98 exam: Free Response 3d</p>";

          document.getElementById("pagetitle").innerHTML = "Applications of the Integral";
          document.getElementById("pagecontent").innerHTML = "<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>How Integrals Are Applied</h2>In general, the integral finds the total of something, whether it be area under the curve, position, area, volume, net, total, accumulated, or change.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Antiderivatives</h2>Sometimes you will see an integral that is no more than shorthand for &quot;find the antiderivative&quot;. Usually those questions are multipule choice and have antiderivatives as possible answers or are free response questions that ask you to find the integral and give you no numerical or graphical data.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Area</h2>As integrals find area under a curve, they can be used to find area. Area is always bounded by something, and it is always positive. A good rule for finding area is take the derivative of the boundry farthest out from the respective axis (usually a function or a line) minus the boundry farthest in. Finding area from the y axis works just like finding area from the x axis: take the integral with respect to y instead of x, and the integrand must be farthest out - farthest in. Be careful to visualize and slice up if necessary the area you are finding: you must consider graphically what the integrals you are using are finding.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding Volume</h2>By Method of Disks: if the volume you are trying to find can be represented as the sum of disks with varying radii along the x or y axis, disks is the way to go. The formula is easy to remember as it is just the familiar pi r squared formula changed so that it is a sum and so that f(x) is the radius of the disks: <img src='http://s1259.photobucket.com/user/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/media/disks_zpstezlsits.png.html' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><p>By Method of Washers: Washers are just disks subtracted. The formula is as follows: <img src='http://s1259.photobucket.com/user/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/media/disks_zpstezlsits.png.html' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img> where f(x) is further from the x axis than g(x), but you will often have to make it up as you go. Here is an example of a problem solved step by step with the washer method: <img src='http://s1259.photobucket.com/user/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/media/stepssolvevolume_zpsrkygyxbi.png.html' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. Note that you more or less must draw a graph to know which function is further, that you use y values as the limits when integrating with respect to y, and that the sketch does not have to be perfect, as the sketch only has to show which function is further from the axis.</p><p>By Method of Cross Section: This topic is probably best left to <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/volume-using-calculus-ic/solids-with-known-cross-sections-ic/v/volume-solid-semicircle-cross-section'>a presentation in a different medium.</a> The only tip I have learned for this is draw it out, even draw the cross section. It is easier to interpret the information that way.</p><p>Note that it is imperative to scan and visually break up all the information you get about volume problems.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>The Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus</h2>The second fundemental theorem of calculus says that <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/secondfund_zpsheuojo2e.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. You may have to use properties of integrals to make the integral go from a constant to the variable.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Accumulation Functions</h2>Integrals can be seen as the accumulation of change in a interval of time. So the integral of velocity accumulates position, the integral of the rate of water flowing into a cup gives the amount of water accumulated in a cup over that interval of time, etc.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Finding antiderivatives: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 82, 88 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 10, Free Response 6</p><p>Finding Area: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 25 &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 34, Free Response 5a</p><p>Finding Volume by Disks: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 43, Free Response 3a</p><p>Finding Volume by Washers: &#39;88 exam: Free Response 3b</p><p>Finding Volume by Cylindrical Shells: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 30</p><p>Finding Volume by Cross Section: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 86</p><p>Finding the Average Value: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 27, Free Response 5b &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 36</p><p>Accumulation Functions and the Second Fundemental Theorem of Calculus: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 15, Free Response 5d  &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 3, Free Response 2c</p><p>Anylitic: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 15, 27, 82, 86, 88, Free Response 5b, 5d &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 3, 10, 36, Free Response 2c, 5a, 6</p><p>Graphical: &#39;88 exam: Question(s) 30, 34, 43, Free Response 3a</p>";

          document.getElementById("pagecontent").innerHTML = "<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>What Is Left to Review</h2>An assortment of topics, loosely connected with previous ones, are left to review.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Differential Equations</h2>When you hear differential equations, it just refers to the fact that you can encounter the numerator and demoninator of the dy/dx expression seperatley. When you see a differential equaiton, get all the y and dy on one side and all the x and dx on another and integrate both sides. Then add a +C to the x side, plug in the information you have with the equation as it stands, and solve for C. Then, get y by itself on one side.<p> It is good to note that when you see the equation <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/differentialyky_zps0yvgatc5.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, the solution to the differential equation is <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/solutdife_zpsxyiqolho.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>, where C is any constant. Note that, when getting y on its own side by undoing ln|y|, the other side can be positive or negative.</p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>U Subsitution with Limits</h2>To do u substitution with limits, simply evaluate what you are replacing at u at the limits of the integral, and when you are evaluating the antiderivative, replace the normal points with what you got by evaluateing what you replaced with u at those points.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Finding an Integral with a Rational Integrand</h2>If the rational integrand is a constant over a sum of squares, find the antiderivative with the formula <img src='http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii545/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/arctanformula_zpsxkqmuyp2.png' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img>. If the rational function is a variable in the numerator with a variable in the denominator that has a power higher by one, do u substitution. Otherwise, use long division and if needed partial fraction expansion.<p>Here is an <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-rational-expr-eq-func/alg-partial-fraction/v/partial-fraction-expansion-1'> intro to partial fraction expansion.</a>You can check partial fraction expansion at every step of the way by plugging in numbers with your calculator, so if you have the time and have a calculator, it may be a good idea to check it at every step to prevent time consuming errors. Along with partial fraction expansion, you may need to use long division, so make sure to <a href='http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/factor/fac01/fac01.html'> brush up on that precal skill.</a></p><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Slope Fields</h2>Slope fields are graphical representations of differential equations. To draw a slope field, test the derivative at each point indicated by the problem and draw the a line with the slope of that derivative at each point. A slope of zero makes a horizontal line and an undefind slope makes a vertical line. You may have to figure out which function may be a possible solution on a slope field. To do that, pick a point and follow the slope, or test the derivative of that function at certian points.<h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Integrals and Derivatives from Graphs</h2>You will often be asked to find graphs of derivatives from graphs of integrals and graphs of integrals from graphs of derivatives. Some things are easy visually, such as the maxes and mins, which must correspond to the derivative crossing the x axis. However, concavity and inflection points look wierd. So, here is a table to review: <img src='http://s1259.photobucket.com/user/GroverClevlandsBiggestFan/media/visualdydx_zpsm1fyvpwe.png.html' alt='Image Cannot Be Displayed' style='vertical-align:middle;'></img><h2 class='mdc-typography--display1'>Practice Problems</h2>Practice problems for:<p>Solving limits with a graph: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 76</p><p>Differential Equations: &#39;98 exam: Question(s) 21, 84, Free Response 4c</p><p>U substitution with limits:<a href='http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SubstitutionRuleDefinite.aspx'>This website</a> has examples of u substitution with limits.
